Lambda School is a tech bootcamp designed to get you in the industry as quicky as possible.
Here are the experiences I've gathered being an alumni

# The Good

LS at it's core is an environment designed to teach you how to be pragmatic while giving you all the tools you need to be successful in the real world. 

### Curriculum

I'll start off by saying the curriculum is great. You'll learn React, PostgresQL , NodeJS (or Java) on top of the basics of web design and python. It covers everything you need to land an entry - midlevel position as a developer and it's layed out in a way that mimics the real world. The projects will often include a task that requires additional research in order to complete it. It was a struggle to get through the modules at times, but it taught me how to learn effectively while skyrocketing my problem solving skills.

### Instructors

The instructors are very consistent and teach the material *well*. Most of the instructors have a lot of experience and you often get interesting advice and tidbits that will help you out while programming. You also have the option to view lectures from the instructures if you don't find your current teacher up to par.

### Career Support

It's no surprise that a company with this business model would have excellent career support. 
From LinkedIn/Resume reviews to mock interviews you will be ready to start interviewing at the end of Lambda. 

# The Bad

### Disorganization

Lambda School loves to move at an extremely fast pace, constantly innovate and try new things. Although it keeps the curriculum ahead of the curve, management isn't able to keep up and there's been a ton of blunders as a side effect. Some students have been forced to retake months of the curriculum from assignments that weren't received making it extremely discouraging at times. During most of my team projects we were missing vital roles due to poor management and were almost forces to retake the project because of it. It added unnecessary stress to an already stressful environemt and I believe it could have been avoided with better communication.

### Communication

You never actually know what's going on. With policies changing days after being implemented not even the staff can keep up with the changes. This makes communication extraordinarily difficult since changes aren't communicated thorougly to students. This wasn't a problem until recently, before LS had team leads that would manage a small group of students and they were your main resource for help. Information/changes would elegantly trickly down from upper management to the team leads and finally down to the students.

# Summary

Overall, Lambda School has transformed me into a competent developer that's able to think outside the box in order to solve problems.
